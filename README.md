# Customer-Churn-Analysis-Retention-Strategy-for-a-Subscription-Business-OTT-SaaS-
End-to-end customer churn analysis using the IBM Telco dataset. Performed data cleaning and feature engineering in Python, built churn KPIs and customer risk segmentation using DAX, and designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to identify churn drivers and support data-driven retention strategies.
# Business Objective

Customer churn negatively impacts revenue and customer lifetime value. This project aims to:

Identify key factors contributing to customer churn

Segment customers based on churn risk

Provide data-driven recommendations to reduce attrition

# Tools and Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy) for data cleaning and feature engineering

Power BI for data modeling, DAX calculations, and dashboard development

DAX for KPI creation and customer segmentation

Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis

# Methodology

Converted churn labels into a binary churn indicator

Engineered a churn risk score using tenure, contract type, pricing, and support features

Categorized customers into low, medium, and high-risk segments

Created tenure-based customer groupings

Developed DAX measures for churn rate, customer counts, and KPIs

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard with filters and conditional formatting

# Key Insights

Customers with shorter tenure exhibit higher churn rates

Month-to-month contracts are the primary contributors to churn

Higher monthly charges and lack of technical support increase churn likelihood

# Recommendations

Strengthen onboarding programs for new customers

Encourage migration to long-term contracts through incentives

Proactively engage high-risk customers with targeted support initiatives

# Role-Based Documentation

Business Analyst (BA) document focuses on business problem definition, insights, and strategic recommendations

Data Analyst (DA) document focuses on data preparation, analysis, KPI development, and visualization

Outcome

This project demonstrates an end-to-end analytics workflow that combines technical analysis with business insights. It is intended as a portfolio project for Business Analyst and Data Analyst roles.
